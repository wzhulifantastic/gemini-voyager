# Sidebar Width

Folder names too long to see?
Or is the sidebar taking up too much precious chat space?

Now you can freely adjust the width of the sidebar.

## How to Adjust

1. Open the Gemini Voyager settings panel (click the extension icon in the top right of your browser).
   <img src="/assets/extension-instruction.png" alt="How to open settings panel" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-top: 10px; max-width: 600px;"/>
2. Find the **Sidebar width** option in **General Settings**.
3. Drag the slider to choose the width that feels right for you.

- **Narrow**: Save space and focus on the conversation.
- **Wide**: See full folder names clearly at a glance.

## Supported Platforms

This feature supports both:

- **Google Gemini**
- **Google AI Studio**

Your settings are saved automatically and will apply the next time you open the page.
