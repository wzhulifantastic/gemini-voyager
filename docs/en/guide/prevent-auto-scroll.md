# Prevent Auto Scroll

When you are reading past conversations, hitting Enter to send a new prompt causes Gemini to forcefully scroll the page to the bottom to track the newly generated response. This can disrupt your reading experience.

The **Prevent Auto Scroll** feature intercepts this unwanted jumping behavior:

- When you have scrolled up to read history, the system blocks the page from jumping back down.
- This feature is **disabled** by default. You can manually enable it in the popup settings under "Timeline Options".

## How to Enable

1. Click the Gemini Voyager extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.
2. Locate the "Timeline Options" section.
3. Toggle on the "Prevent auto-scroll to bottom" switch.
