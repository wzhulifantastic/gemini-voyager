::: warning
**Security Recommendation: Double Protection**  
While Cloud Sync offers great convenience, we strongly recommend that you also periodically back up your core data using **local files**.

1. **Full Export**: Export a complete package containing all settings, folders, and prompts from "Backup & Restore" at the bottom of the settings panel.

2. **Export All Folders**: Click "Export" in the "Folders" section of the settings panel to back up all your folders and conversations, excluding prompts.
