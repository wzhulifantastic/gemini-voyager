# NanoBanana Option

::: warning Browser Compatibility
Currently, the **NanoBanana** feature is **not supported on Safari** due to browser API limitations. We recommend using **Chrome** or **Firefox** if you need to use this feature.

Safari users can manually upload their downloaded images to [banana.ovo.re](https://banana.ovo.re/) for processing (though success is not guaranteed for all images due to varying resolutions).

**AI Images, kept pure.**

Images generated by Gemini come with a visible watermark by default. While this is intended for safety, there are creative scenarios where you need a perfectly clean slate.

## Lossless Reconstruction

NanoBanana uses a **Reverse Alpha Blending** algorithm.

- **Not AI Inpainting**: Traditional watermark removal often uses AI to "smear" the area, which destroys pixel details.
- **Pixel Perfection**: We use mathematical calculations to precisely remove the transparent watermark layer, restoring the 100% original pixels.
- **Zero Quality Loss**: The processed image remains identical to the original in all non-watermarked areas.

## How to Use

1. **Enable it**: Find "NanoBanana Option" at the end of the Gemini Voyager settings panel and toggle it on.
2. **Auto-process**: Every image you generate will now be automatically processed in the background.
3. **Download directly**:
   - Hover over a processed image and you'll see a 🍌 button.
   - **The 🍌 button completely replaces** the native download button to ensure you always get the 100% unwatermarked image directly.
